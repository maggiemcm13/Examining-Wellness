<h1>What?</h1>
<h4>What area of wellness did you determine you wanted to focus on? Why did you choose this
 area of wellness? What were you feeling when choosing an area of wellness to focus on?
    </h4>
    <p>I chose to focus on emotional wellness because I was aware of how my mental health has been affected by
        the transition from home to college. I was feeling unsteady and in need of support when I chose this area.
       </p>
       <h4>Which activity did you choose from the wellness categories? When selecting this activity

        how did you think or hope it would support your overall wellness? Why did you choose the
        
        activity you did?
        </h4>
        <p>I chose to arrange sessions with a therapist through <a class="well" href="https://www.american.edu/student-affairs/counseling/" >The Center for Well-Being Programs and Psychological Services</a> because I knew that they would be equipped to help me work through what I was feeling. I hoped they would be able to teach me some healthy mechanisms for coping and building a better life here.</p>
    <h4>How did it feel to engage with your selected area of wellness and your selected activity?</h4>
    <p> It felt very relieving to finally meet with a therapist because I was able to get some things off my chest and feel fully supported.</p>
