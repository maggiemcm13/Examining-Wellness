<h1>Now What?</h1>
<h4>What will you take from the activity that you would like to apply to the rest of your
    semester? What will you continue to do to support your overall wellness beyond this
    semester?
    </h4>
    <p>I am going to apply the tools I learn in therapy to my thought processes throughout the rest of my semester. Beyond this semester,
        I will continue to seek out professional help when I feel like I need it.
       <h4>How did you approach utilizing AU’s resources and what would you do differently next
        time? If you didn’t use a specific campus resource for this assignment, how will you
        approach utilizing them in the future?
    </h4>
        <p>I would've sought out AU's counseling resources sooner because the process took quite a while and some of the mental challenges
            I experienced had already passed by the time I had my first session.
