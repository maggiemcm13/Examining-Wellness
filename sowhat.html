<h1>So What?</h1>
<h4>What did you learn from the activity about the wellness areas you identified? Did anything
    surprise you about participating in the activity? Why or why not?
    </h4>
    <p>I learned from this activity that emotional wellness involves a lot of awareness about something we may think is conceptual.
        I was surprised at how difficult it could be to label how I was feeling because emotions can be very subjective things.
       <h4>Were there moments when you were outside of your comfort zone? If you were outside
        your comfort zone, how did you deal with that? If you werenâ€™t outside of your comfort zone,
        how did the experience impact you?
    </h4>
        <p>I definitely felt out of my comfort zone having to open up to a complete stranger, but I dealt with it by keeping in 
            mind the fact that they were there to help me and that they knew what they were doing.
        </p>
    <h4>To incorporate new aspects of wellness you wanted to develop, what parts of your routine
        had to change? How did those changes impact you? If parts of your routine did not need to
        change, do you think a routine change would better support your wellness?
         How did your chosen activity relate to your sense of wellbeing at AU?</h4>
    <p> I had to change certain days of my week in order to accomodate the sessions, but these changes were positive because
        I felt like I was doing something for me and my wellness. It made me feel taken care of and like I was truly improving as a person because I'm nurturing my future self,
        which I learned to do from the reading of <a href="https://american.instructure.com/courses/49487/files/4625610?wrap=1" > "The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits and How Your Habits Shape Your Identity"</a>
